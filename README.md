# Blast
Converts VAN Lists into CSV tables.

This project was made for the **Harris / Walz** campaign as a utility for processing internal volunteer data.

All data processed by this utility is done so with frontend javascript code, this way there is no data transfer over the internet. Once the webpage has loaded, you can even disconnect from the internet and still use the utility!

No data is ever sent to a 3rd party server.

## Features
- Process bulk VAN email lists into CSV files
- Download CSV files
- View RAW CSV data as generated
- Supports complex last names (more than a single word)
